# dzhigit
Git implementation using Golang 

## Motivation
I am using git in a daily basics but know nothing about the internal data structures used by git. It took Linus a few weeks to implement git , how many months it will take me ? Will see...

## TODO
1. add 
2. [X] cat-file 
3. checkout 
4. [X] commit-tree
5. [X] hash-object 
6. [X] init 
7. log 
8. [X] ls-tree 
9. merge - To consider
10. rebase - To consider
11. rev-parse 
12. rm 
13. show-ref 
14. tag
15. [X] index
16. [X] write-tree
17. [ ] update-ref
    
## How it works
### Blobs
The blobs a basically implemented in the same way they work in original git.
Blob file contains two peaces of information
1. Header
2. Zipped data
Here is the format for blob file `type length\x00zipped_data` where
1. **type** - the object type followed by space (blob,tree etc)
2. *length* - the length of unzipped data(without header)
3. **\x00** - null character
4. **zipped_data** - zipped representation of original data(without header)

### Index file
In order to implement staging aread git uses [Index file](https://mincong.io/2018/04/28/git-index/) but original Index format is complex binary file and it contains too much information. The Index file used by `dzhigit` will be a simple text file with a list of entries in the following format
```
Mode C_time M_time sha1-hash F_name
...
```
Where
1. **Mode** - is a file mode(100644 - normal file,100755 - executable)
2. **C_time** - file's creation time in unix
2. **M_time** - file's last modification time in unix
2. **sha1-hash** - file's hash generated by `dzhigit hash-object command`
2. **F_name** - file's name
